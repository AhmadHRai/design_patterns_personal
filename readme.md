# Key Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns

**Singleton Pattern:**
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Factory Method Pattern:**
Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

**Abstract Factory Pattern:**
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structural Patterns

**Adapter Pattern:**
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface.

**Decorator Pattern:**
Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**Facade Pattern:**
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

## Behavioral Patterns

**Observer Pattern:**
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Strategy Pattern:**
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Template Method Pattern:**
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

## Additional Patterns

**Builder Pattern:**
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern:**
Allows a set of classes to handle a request by passing it along a chain until it is handled.

**Iterator Pattern:**
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
